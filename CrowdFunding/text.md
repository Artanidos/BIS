# Who
Hi, my name is Olaf Japp.
I am a software developer since more than 30 years now.
I have studied graphics and interaction design.
I have worked for many top 500 companies, before I stepped out 6 years ago to create open source software.

# Why
Today more than 70 % of all the work is been made by computers and robots.
There is not much work left for us human beings.
So countries are struugling with unemployed and even homeless people.

# How
The solution would be to give all people around the globe an universal basic income, but the governments don't know how to finance that and they also fear that they loose tax income for people not working anymore or less hours.

# How
Today I am showing you a very easy and cheap solution.

Lets image you **download** the app to your mobile phone and from that day on you will receive a **basic income** on a daily base.
You don't even have to register. 
Completely anonymous.
You are able to pay with this app, even without being **online**. Just use your camera to scan a QR code to transfer coins from one mobile to the other.

We are talking about a crypto currency based on blockchain technology, called **THX**, the shortform for Thank you.

This currency is based on time. So if an ingineer in Switzerland is working for 1 hour we will pay him 60 THX. One THX for each minute. When a hairdresser in New Dehli is working for one hour he also gets 60 THX.
Isn't that **fair**?
No discriminating anymore.

It's getting even better.
Just imagine that this currency also has got a demurage. So it looses it's value over time. That is exactly the opposit of what we have now with **compound interest**.
If someone tries to hoard the money he will **loose it all** one day.
So he reuses the money to let it flow through the economy.

What can you pay with these new coins you may ask?
Well, this depends on the **acceptance** of all other people.
Maybe you will not be able to pay your rent or food with these coins, but you can use this money in sharing circles, as alternative for timebanks, you can pay neighbors for their services and you can also give services where you also accept these coins.

# Help Wanted
If you find this idea useful, then please help and give birth to this, what I think, incredible idea.

You can share this campaign to friends.
You can talk about the idea to colleages.
And of course you can donate money.

As a reward for your donation you will get the release candidate of the app a few weeks before official start and you may already collect basic income.


# How the money is used
The first goal is to create an app on Android.
I need about 3.300,- € to support myself.
I have to pay the internet for at least 3 month which costs about 90,- €.
To deploy the app on Google Play I have to pay 25,- €.
That makes a minimum amount of 3.415.- € for Android.

To be able to support Windows Phone I need a device which is about 120,- €.
And I have to pay the Microsoft store which makes 100,- €.
I need about 500,- € to support myself.
That makes 720,- € for WinPhone.

To be able to support the iPhone I need an iPhone which is about 500,- €.
To be able to write software for the iPhone I also need a Mac which is another 2.800,- €.
And the Apple Store is asking for 100,- €.
I need about 500,- € to support myself.
That makes 3.900,- € for iPhone.

To support a cash station based on Raspberry Pi I need a Pi for 120,- €.
I also need a screen for the Pi which costs 40,- €.
And also a QR-scanner is needed for 40,- €.
I need about 500,- € to support myself.
That makes 700,- € for the Raspberry Pi.

To support a cash station based on Linux I need additional 500,- €.
To support a cash station based on Windows I need additional 500,- €.
To support a cash station based on Mac I need additional 500,- €.

To create an amazing visual design I would invest 500,- € into a 99designs campaign.
And I need additional 1.000,- € in case I need help from another developer.

If I collect more money, the I will use it for a wonderful project here in Portugal.
We are about to create a self sustained community here and we need some money for creating buildings and to repair an old ruin.

All together that will make 11.735,- €.
I have to give 10 % to IndiGoGo, so 1174,- €
Summary 11.259,- €

Withe specific pledges you will support a specific platform to become priority.

# What You get
You will get the app categorized as game, that makes it easiser to not have a conflict with authoryties. 
First it will come out for Android and then it depends, how much money I am able to collect (see above)
For every EUR you spend you will get one THX booked onto your account.
The app will of course will be open source, so it can be developed further.
The apps will be written with Python and PyQt5.

# In Case
In the case that the first target of 3.415,- € will not be reached, I will not be able to finish the project, but you will get all the source code for the project and the design material, so that another developer might finish the software. 
In that case I am using all the money to support the mentioned community project, so that the money will be used for something beneficial.

# Why is that soo cheap
I am living in a van, so I don't have to pay a house.
I am living a minimalistic lifestyle and I don't pay taxes.
I am not greedy anymore and I want to give that to the world <3
